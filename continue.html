		<b> The crewman has escorted you to a place where other crewmen are reading books... </b> <br/> <br/>
		This is clearly a place where people sit and read books, however these books are different. While appearing as hardbacks, <br/>
		they are actually books that have flexible electronic pages. You notice the person next to you whose book is open to a <br/>
		picture of you! <br/> <br/>
		Pointing to your picture, you say to the crewman "Hey, that's me!" The crewman responds, "Yes, we are happy to have you <br/>
		visit." But you know they are not being truthful, because your glasses automatically tanslate the alien text. You <br/> 
		discover that, through this species means of virtual communication, they have actually been making cruel jokes and <br/>
		snide comments; targeting you for harassment. The crewman leaves the room, but leaves the book on the side table. <br/> <br/> 
		What do you do?
