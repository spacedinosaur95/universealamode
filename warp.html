		<p>
			<b>You discover that you are on a foreign spacecraft and an unidentified crewman is running at you. <br/> 
			The crewman says: </b> <br/> <br/>
			"Hey! How did you get on this ship!? Anyways, you looked scared, and not from around here. Just <br/>
			try not to make any funny faces. The ship is equipped with an advanced facial recognition controls <br/>
			system. Our controls systems guide and serve the inhabitants by using facial recognition software. <br/>
			You must have some really strong emotions to make the ship go this fast! OH WAIT! You must be a <br/>human!"

			What do you do?
