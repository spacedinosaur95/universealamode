		<p>
			<b> You come upon a man holding a package surrounded by rabid zombies yelling, </b> <br/> <br/>
			“Brains?!?! What Brains?!? I’m gonna starve!!!” <br/>
			The zombie mob continues yelling insults at the man, ganging up on him.  You jump in! <br/>
			You push zombies aside and tell them to go back to the graves they came from! 
			<br/> <br/> 
		</p> 
	
		<p>
		You grab your laser from your belt and atomize every zombie insight!<br/>
		The man expresses his thanks, and offers a gift in return. <br/>
		You see a perfectly crafted apple pie.<br/>
		Victory is sweet!
